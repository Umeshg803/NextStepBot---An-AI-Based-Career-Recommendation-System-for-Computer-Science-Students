An AI-Based Career Recommendation System for Computer Science Students
It is crucial for students to evaluate their skills and interests as they progress through their academics and pursue the courses they are interested in taking so that they can learn which professional field their interests and skills will place them in. 
This will aid them in enhancing their performance and inspiring their interests, guiding them towards their desired career and helping them settle there. These types of career recommender systems also assist recruiters in determining which job role the candidate should be retained in depending on his or her performance and other evaluations while recruiting the candidates after examining them in all different aspects. Computer science domain candidates are the major topic of the project.
